# External pseudonym

KARNAK will always use a given pseudonym when de-identifying. You have several ways to define the pseudonym when creating the destination. You can provide your pseudonyms via this page by two methods.

The first one, is to associate your pseudonym to the pseudonym generated by Mainzelliste.

The second one, is to keep your pseudonym temporary (7 days) in KARNAK.
